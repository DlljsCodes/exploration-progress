# Exploration Progress

A simple program that allows [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) explorer players to see their progress from one star system to another.

This is just a proof of concept for now. I will expand this into a plugin for [EDMC](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) later, which will allow players to track their progress in real time from the EDMC interface.

## Requirements
* Python 3.7
* Internet connection (to connect to [EDSM](https://www.edsm.net/))

## How to Use
1. Run standalone.py
2. Enter the system you started at (origin system)
3. Enter the system you are heading towards (destination system)
4. Enter the system your current system (current system)
5. Your progress towards the destination system will be displayed as a percentage
