# Exploration Progress

Exploration Progress is a tool that allows [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) explorer players to see their progress from one star system to another as a percentage. It comes in the form of a plugin for [Elite Dangerous Market Connector](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) (EDMC).

This was made while making a journey from Beagle Point back to the bubble after completing the [Distant Worlds 2](https://dw2expedition.wixsite.com/home) expedition. It took me quite a while to get back due to other commitments and increased boredom of jumping endlessly through the deep darkness of space. I wanted to see how far I was towards my destination in a simple way, not by plotting it on a map or watching a distance counter tick down, so I created this solution and shared it so other explorers can benefit from it.

This EDMC plugin uses its many features to get real-time information on your CMDR's current location and display an auto updating progress indicator on the EDMC interface. The origin and destination system names are saved to your machine so you don't have to keep entering them every time.

**Please note:** Just like EDMC itself, this plugin only supports the PC & macOS versions of Elite Dangerous. Console (i.e. PS4 & Xbox One) versions are not supported.

*If you're looking for the original standalone version of Exploration Progress, you can find it [here](https://github.com/DlljsCodes/exploration-progress-standalone). However, it is now depreciated and no support will be given for it.*
